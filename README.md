AI Chatbot with URL-Based Content Understanding
This repository implements an AI-powered chatbot capable of extracting, processing, and answering questions about web articles and documents from URLs. The workflow includes text loading, chunking, embeddings generation, and leveraging FAISS for indexing combined with Groq Llama LLM for natural language understanding.

Features
Load Web Content: Extracts and processes text from webpages and unstructured data using a URL as input.
Text Chunking: Splits long articles into manageable chunks for efficient processing and embeddings generation.
Embeddings Creation: Converts text into high-dimensional vector embeddings for semantic understanding.
FAISS Indexing: Utilizes FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for fast and scalable retrieval of relevant content.
LLM Integration: Employs the Groq Llama LLM for answering user queries with high accuracy and contextual understanding.
Interactive Q&A: Provides an interactive chatbot interface for asking questions and receiving detailed answers.
Workflow
1. Load Web Content
Input a webpage URL.
Extract textual content using a text loader designed to handle unstructured and semi-structured HTML content.
2. Preprocessing and Chunking
Text is split into smaller chunks based on semantic boundaries (e.g., paragraphs or sentences).
Chunking ensures compatibility with the LLM's context window size and improves processing efficiency.
3. Generate Embeddings
Each chunk is converted into vector embeddings using a state-of-the-art transformer-based embedding model.
Embeddings capture the semantic essence of the content for accurate similarity matching.
4. Build FAISS Index
Embeddings are indexed using FAISS, a library optimized for fast nearest-neighbor searches.
This step enables quick retrieval of relevant chunks based on the userâ€™s query.
5. Query Answering with Groq Llama
User queries are matched with the most relevant chunks using FAISS.
The Groq Llama LLM processes the retrieved chunks and formulates detailed and contextually accurate responses.
